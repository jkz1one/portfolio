# Engineering Portfolio

This repo powers my personal portfolio site. It pulls together my core projects — **SignalFlow**, **Curator Finder**, **PiTV**, and **KeazeMusic** — to show how I work end-to-end: backend, automation, infrastructure, and UI.

## Stack

- **Framework:** Next.js 15 (App Router)
- **Language:** TypeScript
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS
- **Fonts:** Geist (`next/font`)
- **Deployment:** Vercel

## What the Site Shows

The portfolio is focused on real, shipped projects:

- **SignalFlow** – Real-time stock screener built with FastAPI + Next.js, tiered watchlists, and automated data pipelines.
- **Curator Finder** – Local-first desktop app (FastAPI + HTML/JS) for playlist curator discovery, scraping, and CRM-ready exports.
- **PiTV** – Raspberry Pi TV dashboard using Firefox ESR in kiosk mode, GeoClue static geolocation, and systemd-managed startup.
- **KeazeMusic.com** – Artist site with a custom discography grid, lightbox overlays, and VHS-style visual treatments.

Each project section highlights:

- What the tool does
- The stack and architecture
- Screenshots and live/demo links (where relevant)
- My role and responsibilities
